# FinancialPython

This a repository of my financial python projects, containing both demos as well as functions ready for use in financial methods. Note that most of these analyses are basic and will grow in complexity as time progresses. 

For a specific use case, take a look at the demos folder. For general use, take a look at the functions folder.
