# FinancialPython

FinancialPython uses the Alpaca Trading API to save market data and analyze recent stock patterns based on a custom trading algorithim. While FinacialPython could be adapted into an algorthimic trading function, it's purpose is to aid clients in performing analysis using their own strategies based on technical analysis. FinancialPython allows for efficent scaling of simple to complex trading rules to many stocks. Decisons can then be made on the results of these tradinf rules. This is not meant as a replacement for traditional stock picking and should not be regarded as a sole alternative method of a analysis. 

Custom indicators have been built to aid in analysis, including commonly found indicators such as the moving average and MACD indicators. FinancialPython is highly flexible and allows for granular control of tiemframes and methods by which indicators are calculated.
